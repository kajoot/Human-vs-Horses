# Human-vs-Horses
# 1.Abstract
Horses or Humans is a dataset of 300Ã—300 images, created by Laurence Moroney, that is licensed CC-By-2.0 for anybody to use in learning or testing computer vision algorithms.

# 2.Overview
When learning Computer Vision, in particular the training of DNNs and CNNs to recognize and classify images, there is a dearth of good datasets, and you tend to see the same old datasets again and again.

I wanted to fix that problem:

I wanted a dataset that could be used for teaching binary classifiers that were unique and distinct from existing datasets.
I wanted to see if I could use Photoreal CGI to train a neural network that could then recognize and classify real images with the same subject matter
The result is Horses-v-Humans.

# 3.Data
The set contains 500 rendered images of various species of horse in various poses in various locations. It also contains 527 rendered images of humans in various poses and locations. Emphasis has been taken to ensure the diversity of humans, and to that end, there are both men and women as well as Asian, Black, South Asian, and Caucasians present in the training set. The validation set adds 6 different figures of different gender, race, and poses to ensure breadth of data.
